# Application Case 2.5

## US Bank Customer Recognition and Services

As of July 2017, US Bank has been able to automatically identify military service members and veterans when they call or enter one of its branches This is not a simple task. The service members are recognized by Einstein, an AI-based CRM service from Salesforce Inc. (see Section 2.9).

What US Bank is trying to do is to recognize customers and understand their needs. Einstein helps the bank gain a competitive advantage in doing so. Knowledge provided is important not only for marketing and providing targeted professional financial services but also for greeting customers on their birthdays or thanking them for using the bank’s services.

The bank now has considerable information about customers available to human agents in real time. Such information helps customers when online and when at one of the bank’s actual locations.

The AI application tells the rep all about the customer so the rep can offer appropriate services. For example, if the customer needs insurance, the AI will detect this need and the rep will offer a good alternative. It also offers information to an online customer: “Hello, Mary; I see you are checking your mortgage payments. I have good news for you. . . .”

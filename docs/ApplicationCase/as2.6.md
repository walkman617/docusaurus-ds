# Application Case 2.6

## How Alexander Mann Solutions (AMS) Is Using AI to Support the Recruiting Process

Alexander Mann is a Chicago-based company that offers AI solutions to support the employee recruitment process. The major objective is to help companies solve HRM problems and challenges. The AI is used to:
1. Help companies evaluate applicants and their resumes by using machine learning. The result is the decision regarding which applicants to invite for an interview.
2. Help companies evaluate resumes that are posted on the Web. The AI software can use key words for the search related to the background of employees (e.g., training, years of experience).
3. Evaluate the resumes of the best employees who currently work in a company and create, accordingly, desired profiles to be used when vacancies occur. These profiles are then compared to those of applying candidates, and the top ones are ranked by their fit to each job opening. In addition to the ranking, the AI program shows the fit with each desired criterion. At this stage, the human recruiter can make a final selection decision. This way, the selection process is faster and much more accurate.

The accuracy of the process solves the candidate volume problem, ensuring that qualified people are not missed and poorly fit applicants are not selected.

Alexander Mann is also helping its clients to install chatbots that can provide candidates’ answers to questions related to the jobs and the working conditions at the employing company. (For the recruiting chatbot, see Dickson, 2017).

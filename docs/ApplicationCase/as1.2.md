## SNAP DSS Helps OneNet Make Telecommunications Rate Decisions

Telecommunications network services to educational institutions and government entities are typically provided by a mix of private and public organizations. Many states in the United States have one or more state agencies that are responsible for providing network services to schools, colleges, and other state agencies. One example of such an agency is OneNet in Oklahoma. OneNet is a division of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and operated in cooperation with the Office of State Finance.

Usually agencies such as OneNet operate as an enterprise-type fund. They must recover their costs through billing their clients and/or by justifying appropriations directly from the state legislatures. This cost recovery should occur through a pricing mechanism that is efficient, simple to implement, and equitable. This pricing model typically needs to recognize many factors: convergence of voice, data, and video traffic on the same infrastructure; diversity of user base in terms of educational institutions and state agencies; diversity of applications in use by state clients from e-mail to videoconferences, IP telephoning, and distance learning; recovery of current costs as well as planning for upgrades and future developments; and leverage of the shared infrastructure to enable further economic development and collaborative work across the state that leads to innovative uses of OneNet.

These considerations led to the development of a spreadsheet-based model. The system, SNAP-DSS, or Service Network Application and Pricing (SNAP)-based DSS, was developed in Microsoft Excel 2007 and used the VBA programming language.

The SNAP-DSS offers OneNet the ability to select the rate card options that best fit the preferred pricing strategies by providing a real-time, user- friendly, graphical user interface (GUI). In addition, the SNAP-DSS not only illustrates the influence of the changes in the pricing factors on each rate card option but also allows the user to analyze various rate card options in different scenarios using different parameters. This model has been used by OneNet financial planners to gain insights into their customers and analyze many what-if scenarios of different rate plan options.

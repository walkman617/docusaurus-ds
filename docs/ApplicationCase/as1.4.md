# Application Case 1.4

## Siemens Reduces Cost with the Use of Data Visualization

Siemens is a German company headquartered in Berlin, Germany. It is one of the worldâ€™s largest companies focusing on the areas of electrification, automation, and digitalization. It has an annual revenue of 76 billion euros.

The visual analytics group of Siemens is tasked with end-to-end reporting solutions and consulting for all of Siemens internal BI needs. This group was facing the challenge of providing reporting solutions to the entire Siemens organization across different departments while maintaining a balance between governance and self-service capabilities. Siemens needed a platform that could analyze its multiple cases of customer satisfaction surveys, logistic processes, and financial reporting. This platform should be easy to use for their employees so that they could use these data for analysis and decision making. In addition, the platform should be easily integrated with existing Siemens systems and give employees a seamless user experience.

Siemens started using Dundas BI, a leading global provider of BI and data visualization solutions. It allowed Siemens to create highly interactive dashboards that enabled it to detect issues early and thus save a significant amount of money. The dashboards developed by Dundas BI helped Siemens global logistics organization answer questions like how different supply rates at different locations affect the operation, thus helping the company reduce cycle time by 12 percent and scrap cost by 25 percent.

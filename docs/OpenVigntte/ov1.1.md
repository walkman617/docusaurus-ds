KONE is a global industrial company (based in Finland) that manufactures mostly eleva- tors and escalators and also services over 1.1 million elevators, escalators, and related equipment in several countries. The company employs over 50,000 people.


## The problem…

Over 1 billion people use the elevators and escalators manufactured and serviced by KONE every day. If equipment does not work properly, people may be late to work, can- not get home in time, and may miss important meetings and events. So, KONE’s objective is to minimize the downtime and users’ suffering.

The company has over 20,000 technicians who are dispatched to deal with the elevators anytime a problem occurs. As buildings are getting higher (the trend in many places), more people are using elevators, and there is more pressure on elevators to handle the growing amount of traffic. KONE faced the responsibility to serve users smoothly and safely.

## The solution…

KONE decided to use IBM Watson IoT Cloud platform. As we will see in Chapter 6, IBM installed cognitive abilities in buildings that make it possible to recognize situations and behavior of both people and equipment. The Internet of Things (IoT), as we will see in Chapter 13, is a platform that can connect millions of “things” together and to a central command that can manipulate the connected things. Also, the IoT connects sensors that are attached to KONE’s elevators and escalators. The sensors collect information and data about the elevators (such as noise level) and other equipment in real time. Then, the IoT transfers to information centers via the collected data “cloud.” There, analytic systems (IBM Advanced Analytic Engine) and AI process the collected data and predict things such as potential failures. The systems also identify the likely causes of problems and suggest poten- tial remedies. Note the predictive power of IBM Watson Analytics (using machine learning, an AI technology described in Chapters 4–6) for finding problems before they occur.

The KONE system collects a significant amount of data that are analyzed for other purposes so that future design of equipment can be improved. This is because Watson Analytics offers a convenient environment for communication of and collaboration around the data. In addition, the analysis suggests how to optimize buildings and equip- ment operations. Finally, KONE and its customers can get insights regarding the financial aspects of managing the elevators.

KONE also integrates the Watson capabilities with Salesforce’s service tools (Service Cloud Lightning and Field Service Lightning). This combination helps KONE to immedi- ately respond to emergencies or soon-to-occur failures as quickly as possible, dispatch- ing some of its 20,000 technicians to the problems’ sites. Salesforce also provides superb customer relationship management (CRM). The people–machine communication, query, and collaboration in the system are in a natural language (an AI capability of Watson Analytics; see Chapter 6). Note that IBM Watson analytics includes two types of analytics: predictive, which predicts when failures may occur, and prescriptive, which recommends actions (e.g., preventive maintenance).


## The results…
KONE has minimized downtime and shortened the repair time. Obviously, elevators/ escalators users are much happier if they do not have problems because of equipment downtime, so they enjoy trouble-free rides. The prediction of “soon-to-happen” can save many problems for the equipment owners. The owners can also optimize the schedule of their own employees (e.g., cleaners and maintenance workers). All in all, the decision mak- ers at both KONE and the buildings can make informed and better decisions. Some day in the future, robots may perform maintenance and repairs of elevators and escalators.
